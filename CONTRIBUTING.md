## Bug Reporting

Your code doesn't work, and you have determined that the issue lies with `MB2CommunityEditor`? Follow these steps to report a bug.

1. Your bug may already be fixed. Make sure to update to the current MB2CommunityEditor master branch.

2. Search for similar issues. Make sure to delete is:open on the issue search to find solved tickets as well. It's possible somebody has encountered this bug already. Also remember to check out MB2CommunityEditor' FAQ. Still having a problem? Open an issue on Github.

3. Make sure you provide us with useful information about your configuration: what OS are you using? What kind of operations you are doing. What is the expected output? What output you actually get?

4. Provide us with a script or snapshot to reproduce the issue. We recommend that you use Github Gists to post your code. Any issue that cannot be reproduced is likely to be closed.

If possible, take a stab at fixing the bug yourself --if you can!

The more information you provide, the easier it is for us to validate that there is a bug and the faster we'll be able to take action. If you want your issue to be resolved quickly, following the steps above is crucial.

## Requesting a Feature

1. Provide a clear and detailed explanation of the feature you want and why it's important to add. Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset.

2. Provide code snippets demonstrating the API you have in mind and illustrating the use cases of your feature. Of course, you don't need to write any real code at this point!

3. After discussing the feature you may choose to attempt a Pull Request. If you're at all able, start writing some code. We always have more work to do than time to do it. If you can write some code then that will speed the process along.
